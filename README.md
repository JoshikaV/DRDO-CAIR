🧠 YOLOv5-Based Object Detection for Rescue Scenarios
This project uses a pretrained YOLOv5 model to detect rescue-relevant objects like people, vehicles, and buildings in aerial or disaster-scene images.

📌 Objectives
Apply YOLOv5 to real-world rescue scenarios
Visualize object detection results with bounding boxes
Identify model limitations (e.g., poor detection on certain structures)

🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
Python, OpenCV, Google Colab
Ultralytics YOLOv5
Pretrained COCO model

📉 Limitations
Detection failed on some complex building structures
Performance depends on image resolution and angle

📈 Future Work
Fine-tune with custom rescue-specific datasets
Deploy detection on video streams
